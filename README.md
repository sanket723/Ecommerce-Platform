# Ecommerce-Platform
This is my first Major Project.

Designed and implemented a custom ecommerce platform using Java and JavaFX.

Developed and maintained a MySQL database to store and manage products, sellers, and buyers.

Utilized Java and MySQL to implement features such as user accounts, product listings.

Utilized Java and MySQL to implement a user-friendly search and filter system for buyers to browse and discover products.

I hope these points give you an idea of the types of responsibilities and achievements.
